CIA Triad:
The main focus of the CIA triad in this assignment was confidentiality. 
This program is making sure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information. 
Since I have a username and password while also having role based permissions the program prevents unauthorized users from accessing certain data.

App Logic:
This prorgram uses a simple hardcoded username and password system for authentication.
After logging in the program assigns a role and displays a menu for the user to choose from.
The Admin account has access to both Admin and User menus, while the User account only has access to the User menu.
The program checks the users role before allowng each action, this shows role based access control or RBAC.
